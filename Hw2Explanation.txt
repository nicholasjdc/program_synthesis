In Hw2 I implemented bottom up search in a recursive model
using "seenAnswers" variable as a way of eliminating equivalent solutions.
More specifically, during each iteration the result of the new function is 
checked to see if is in "seenAnswers". If so, that version of the function is 
skipped. If not, the that function is then added to seenAnswers, tested, and expanded.
